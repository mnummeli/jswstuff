Presumably you have just unzipped a file called "zxwtbs.zip". This
archive contains files relating to "ZX Willy the Bug Slayer"; you
should have:

README (this file)
zxwtbs.txt (documentation)
zxwtbs.tap (file to load into your Spectrum emulator)
zxwtbs.jsw (text file from which the game was compiled)

If you don't understand this, or have any commentd, visit:
